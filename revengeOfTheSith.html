			In Coruscant, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker rescue the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from the Separatist General Grievous' spaceship and <br>
			Anakin kills Count Dooku with his light-saber after a fight; however Grievous escapes from the Jedi. When they land on Coruscant, Padme Amidala comes to tell<br>
			Anakin that she is pregnant. Soon he has premonitions of his wife dying during the delivery. Palpatine requests that Anakin join the Jedi Council against the will <br>
			of the members but he is not promoted to Master and stays at the rank of Knight; further they ask him to spy on Palpatine. Anakin is manipulated by Palpatine about the <br>
			true intentions of the Jedi and is tempted to know the dark side of the Force that could be capable of saving Padme. Further Palpatine discloses that he is Sith Lord Darth Sidious. <br>
			What will Anakin do?
