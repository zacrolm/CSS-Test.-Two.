		<h2><u>A Brief Summery</u></h2>
		
		<p>
			Near the forest moon of Endor the new Death Star is being constructed in orbit, and a command star destroyer arrives and launches a <br>
			shuttle with a fighter escort -- a shuttle bearing the Dark Lord of the Sith. Fearing his arrival, the commander of the new Death Star<br>
			informs Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) that the station will be operational on schedule, but when Vader challenges this <br>
			"optimistic" appraisal of the situation, the commander admits that he needs more men to accelerate construction. Darth Vader, however, informs the <br>
			ommander that the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) will be arriving soon, and that he is most displeased with the commander's progress. Shaken, the commander commits <br>
			to redoubling construction efforts. Vader, pleased, remarks, "the Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
